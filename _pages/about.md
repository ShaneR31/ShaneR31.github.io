I am a master's student at the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering, specializing in Information Systems Engineering. Previously, I worked as an Analyst with Deloitte's Cyber and Strategic Risk practice. I have a strong foundation in data analysis, cybersecurity, and automation, with a particular interest in leveraging data-driven insights to enhance security measures and optimize system performance.

Some of my experience includes analyzing data from client security software using Python, automating project status reports, and various ad hoc scripting tasks. I have also contributed to various internal initiatives, designing content based on technical research papers and analyzing use cases for advanced behavior analytics tools in client security suites.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy learning new tools, playing chess, and reading. Currently, I am immersed in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin.
