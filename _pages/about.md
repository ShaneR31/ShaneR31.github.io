I am a master's student at the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering, specializing in Information Systems Engineering. Previously, I worked as an Analyst with Deloitte's Cyber and Strategic Risk practice. Now, I am seeking full-time roles in data analytics.

My experience includes analyzing data from client Privileged Access Management (PAM) software using Python, automating error-prone manual tasks, and executing various ad hoc scripting assignments. I have also contributed to various internal initiatives, designing content based on technical research papers and analyzing use cases for advanced behavior analytics tools in client security suites.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy learning new tools, playing chess, and reading. Currently, I am immersed in the original Dune franchise by Frank Herbert.
